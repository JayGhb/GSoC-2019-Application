# GSoC-2019-Application
Draft application for participating in GSoC 2019 with OpenStreetMap.
This is a first draft application. It is intended to be shared with the OSM community members and get
feedback on it so it can be improved, until April 9.
## You are more than welcome to suggest improvments as Issues on this repository.
It is the only repository I would be happy to see a large number of them :relieved:
