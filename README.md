# GSoC-2019-Application
My accepted application for participating in GSoC 2019 with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org).
The project focuses on implementing 3D Traffic sign rendering capabilities on [OSM2World](http://osm2world.org/),
a converter that generates 3D models of the world from OpenStreetMap data.
